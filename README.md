# swedish_housing_prediction_2024
A Swedish Housing Prediction 2024 - Data Science course from Stockholm School of Economics

This is a Data Science Capstone project under the Data Science course from Stockholm School of Economics.
The project lists around 668k real estate properties in all Sweden from 2008 to 2024, with around 1% properties that have missing sell_price from Aug-24 to Dec-24. Our objective to build a prediction model for sell_price that ensure the best accuracy rate and also resource-saving as well.
